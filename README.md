# ATM Machine Simulation

Welcome to the **ATM Machine Simulation** repository by **sajidz15**!

## Overview

This project simulates an ATM machine system where users can authenticate using a PIN to perform basic banking operations such as:

- Checking account balance
- Withdrawing money
- Depositing money
- Changing PIN

The system ensures secure access and mimics a real ATM experience.

## Features

- PIN-based authentication
- Secure access control
- Basic banking transactions (check balance, withdraw, deposit)
- PIN change functionality
- Simple console-based interface (or GUI if you have one)
